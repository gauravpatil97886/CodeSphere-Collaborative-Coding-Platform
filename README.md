# CodeSphere: Collaborative Coding Platform

Welcome to CodeSphere, your ultimate destination for collaborative coding! With CodeSphere, you can code seamlessly with your team, run long-running backend and frontend applications, and enjoy the flexibility of starting fresh environments in various programming languages like Rust, Go, Python, Node.js, React, and more. 

## What We're Building

1. **Online IDE for Long-Running Apps**: Say goodbye to limitations on your coding sessions. CodeSphere offers an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) where you can develop and run both backend and frontend applications without worrying about time constraints.

2. **Fresh Environment Startup**: Need to switch programming languages or start from scratch? CodeSphere has got you covered with the ability to launch fresh environments effortlessly.

3. **Autoscaling with Users**: Experience seamless scalability as CodeSphere automatically adjusts server resources based on user demand. No more manual scaling or overprovisioning!

4. **Isolated Environment Execution**: Ensure the security and stability of your code execution by running it in isolated environments, providing a safe space for experimentation and development.

## Our Approach

We've taken a cloud-specific approach to building CodeSphere, leveraging autoscaling constructs tailored for cloud environments. This ensures optimal resource management and scalability without the need for users to manage their own cloud infrastructure.

- **Cloud-Specific Autoscaling Constructs**: Utilizing cloud-native autoscaling mechanisms such as AWS EC2 Auto Scaling and Amazon ECS to dynamically adjust compute resources based on predefined metrics, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

- **Mid Approach**: Perfect for startups and small teams looking to build and scale their applications without the overhead of managing infrastructure.

- **Security and Autoscaling**: CodeSphere prioritizes security and scalability, providing a secure environment while seamlessly handling fluctuations in user traffic.

- **Cloud-Dependent Constructs (ASG, ECS)**: We make use of cloud-dependent constructs like Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and Amazon ECS to manage resources efficiently, ensuring smooth operation and scalability.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced development experience.
- **Socket.io**: Real-time bidirectional event-based communication.

**Infrastructure:**

- **Docker / Containerization**: Containerize applications for easy deployment and management.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **AWS ASGs**: Utilize Auto Scaling Groups for automatic scaling of EC2 instances based on demand.
